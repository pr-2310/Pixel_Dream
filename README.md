# PixelDream: 2D Game Asset Generation Using Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

![PixelDream in Action](pr_pixel_dream.gif)  
*Empowering game developers to create high-quality 2D assets effortlessly.*

---

## 🌟 Overview  
PixelDream leverages advanced Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models, fine-tuned using our custom dataset **PixelAssets**, to simplify and enhance 2D game asset creation. This tool helps game developers, especially indie teams, generate production-ready assets using natural language descriptions, reducing development time and costs.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Effortless Asset Creation**: Generate 2D game-ready sprites and assets with simple text prompts.  
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Enhanced stylistic and content-specific outputs tailored for 2D games.  
- **Low-Cost Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes LoRA for parameter-efficient model fine-tuning.  
- **Integration Ready**: Models compatible with Stable Diffusion WebUI for broader usage.

## 🚀 Execution  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pr-2310/Pixel_Dream.git
cd PixelDream
```

### 2. Download Checkpoints  
- **Base Model**: [Download here](https://civitai.green/models/1010709/pixeldream)  
  *(Place it in the `models/stable-diffusion` folder of your Stable Diffusion WebUI directory)*  
- **LoRA Checkpoint**: [Download here](https://civitai.green/models/1010793/pixeldreamlora)  
  *(Place it in the `models/lora` folder of your Stable Diffusion WebUI directory)*  

### 3. Stable Diffusion WebUI Setup  
1. Clone and setup the [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).  
2. Add the **PixelDream base model** to the `models/stable-diffusion` folder.  
3. Add the **PixelDream LoRA file** to the `models/lora` folder.  
4. Run the WebUI and start generating assets with your custom models!

## 🎨 Training  

### 1. Setup Environment  
Create and activate a conda environment:  
```bash
conda create --name myenv
conda activate myenv
```

Install required packages:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model  
Run the training script to fine-tune the model:  
```bash
bash train.sh
```
Adjust parameters in the script as needed.
